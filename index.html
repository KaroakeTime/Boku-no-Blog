                        <p>Welcome to my blog!</p>
                        <p>This website is intended to be a test of my HTML skills, as well as just something to help apply my learning or whatever, so don't expect anything <em>too</em> impressive. TvT</p>
                        <p>That being said...</p>

                        <p><b><u>What can you expect to find here?</u></b></p>
                        <p>Well... not much as of now. I do have some stuff planned though, such as: </p>
                        <ul>
                              <li>A showcase of some of my <s>fanfic</s> works</li>
                              <li>Some sort of portfolio</li>
                              <li>希望と願望 (きぼうとがんぼう) (Hopes and aspirations)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>More content may or may not be present.<br>What? That's a secret~</p>
